Our engineering team serves as the bridge between the worlds of open source and enterprise: contributing directly to and growing Apache Hudi (already used at scale by global enterprises like Uber, Amazon, ByteDance etc) and concurrently defining a new industry category - the transactional data lake. The Cloud Infrastructure team is the glue that binds all of this together. We enable our data platform and infrastructure teams to be successful by acting as the foundation of a truly cloud native product.

House Values
One Team
Optimize for the company, your team, self - in that order. We may fight long and hard in the trenches, take care of your co-workers with empathy. We give more than we take to build the one house, that everyone dreams of being part of.
Tough & Persevering
We are building our company in a very large, fast-growing but highly competitive space. Life will get tough sometimes. We take hardships in the stride, be positive, focus all energy on the path forward and develop a champion's mindset to overcome odds. Always day one!
Keep Making It Better Always
Rome was not built in a day; If we can get 1% better each day for one year, we'll end up thirty-seven times better. This means being organized, communicating promptly, taking even small tasks seriously, tracking all small ideas, and paying it forward.
Think Big, Act Fast
We have tremendous scope for innovation, but we will still be judged by impact over time. Big, bold ideas still need to be strategized against priorities, broken down, set in rapid motion, measure, refine, repeat. Great execution is what separates promising companies from proven unicorns.
Be Customer Obsessed
Everyone has the responsibility to drive towards the best experience for the customer, be an OSS user or a paid customer. If something is broken, own it, say something, do something; never ignore. Be the change that you want to see in the company."

Scam Notice
Please be aware that there are individuals and organizations that may attempt to scam job seekers by offering fraudulent employment opportunities in the name of CloudBees. These scams may involve fake job postings, unsolicited emails, or messages claiming to be from our recruiters or hiring managers. Please note that CloudBees will never ask for any personal account information, such as cell phone, credit card details or bank account numbers, during the recruitment process. Additionally, CloudBees will never send you a check for any equipment prior to employment.

You've built server-less backend architectures using AWS platforms and resources like Lambda, DynamoDB, Aurora, etc. (Brownie points if you’ve worked with NodeJS, Redis and PostgreSQL);

Job Title
Analytics Engineer
Job Description
Analytics Engineer - Marketing
So, who we are?
Hello, we’re IG Group. No, not Instagram – though we're a pretty big deal ourselves.
We’re a global, FTSE 250-listed company made up of a collection of progressive fintech brands in the world of online trading and investing. The best part? We’ve snapped up many awards for our top-class platforms, forward-thinking products, and incredible employee experiences.
We believe in financial freedom. And our purpose is to help ambitious people achieve it. Around 400,000
people use our groundbreaking technology and forward-thinking platforms to trade the financial products they know and love.
Did we mention we have offices in 18 countries? Yes, when you join IG Group, you'll have the chance to work across multiple brands, with people all over the world. Join us for an exciting future and let’s innovate together!
Your role in the Team
We are seeking to appoint several analytics engineers to support the marketing data analysts in generating new insight on consumers, competitors and competitive advantages.
We’ve been playing a key role in our wider Marketing Strategy set-up and are aiming to optimise the way we do analysis for the group marketing and wider business. For that we need team members to oversee existing marketing tools and data models, work closely with both data analysts and data engineers and ensure data automation, continuity and documentation.
What You’ll Do
The focus of the role, day-to-day, is to deliver the data and documentation in the shape and quality that would allow data analysts and business users to use it in their analysis and get reliable, consistent answers. That means you will:
Work closely with the Marketing Analysts to understand the business cases for analysis, challenges and data requirements
Work closely with Data Engineering team and serve as a marketing data expert, providing support in setting technical requirements, business acceptance testing and maintaining documentation
You’ll be overseeing existing data models, connections and automation for marketing and Identifying opportunities for improving data reliability, efficiency and performance#

You’re also a confident, creative thinker with a knack for innovating. We know that you know every problem has a solution. Here, you can try new ideas, and lead the way in creating inspiring experiences for our clients and everyone around you.
We don’t fit the corporate stereotype. If you want to work for a traditional, suit-and-tie corporate that just gives you a pay cheque at the end of the month, we might not be for you. But, if you have that IG Group energy and you can stand behind what we believe in, let’s raise the bar together.
What You’ll Need For This Role
If you’re inspired by our way of working and can bring something new to our team of topnotch people, then you’ll find a home here.

People who embody our three core values – who want to champion the client, lead the way and love what we do.
We recruit based on excellence and believe that diversity is vital to success. We have zero-tolerance for bullying, harassment or any other behavior that stiﬂes innovation and collaboration.
How You’ll Grow

Stretch yourself, challenge your self-beliefs and go for the things you dream of. With internal and external learning opportunities, and the tools to help you skyrocket to success, we’ll support you all the way.
And these opportunities truly are endless because we have some bold targets. We plan to expand our global presence, increase revenue growth, and ultimately deliver the world’s best trading experience. We’d love to have you along for the ride.
The perks
It really is more than a job. We’ll recognize your talent and make sure that you can still have a life – at work, and outside of it. Networks, committees, awards, sports and social clubs, mentorships, volunteering opportunities, extra time off… the list goes on.
Matched giving for your fundraising activity
Flexible working hours and work-from-home opportunities
Performance-related bonuses
Insurance and medical plans
Career-focused technical and leadership training's in-class and online, incl. unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning platform

The things that make you, you – like your ethnicity, sexual orientation, faith, age, gender identity/expression or physical capacity – can bring a fresh perspective or new skill to our business.
That’s why we welcome people from various walks of life; and anyone who wants to help us realize our vision and strategy.
So, if you’re keen to connect with our values, and lead the charge on innovation, you know what to do.

What is Robotics Process Automation? Robotic Process Automation is the technology that allows anyone today to configure computer software, or a “robot” to emulate and integrate the actions of a human interacting within digital systems to execute a business process. RPA robots utilize
the user interface to capture data and manipulate applications just like humans do.
They interpret, trigger responses, and communicate with other systems to perform on a vast variety of repetitive tasks. Only substantially better: an RPA software robot never sleeps and makes zero mistakes.
